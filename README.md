# Heart_Disease_Prediction_Project


# Problem Statement:


Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an
estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.
Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths
occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused
by CVDs and this dataset contains 21 features that can be used to predict a possible heart
disease.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the
presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or
already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine
learning model can be of great help.

# Objective:

Our aim in this project is to build a Machine Learning model which predicts coronary heart
disease chances. With this model, people can take needed precautions and regularly visit
doctor.
The correct prediction of heart disease can prevent life threats, and incorrect prediction can
prove to be fatal at the same time. In this paper different machine learning algorithms are
applied to compare the results and analysis of CDC Dataset. Wherein we are predicting
chances of heart attack on the basis of surveyed data.
Performing exploratory data analysis of CDC surveyed dataset.
Identifying the factors that impact coronary heart disease.
Developing machine learning models to predict Chances of coronary heart disease.


# Conclusion:

In conclusion, we find that our regression equation is quite accurate (91.68%
accuracy) in predicting the heart disease with Random Forest Regressor. People
can use it to Predict their Heart Health Status. People need to focus on their
Physical Health, General Health, Smoking Habits, Exercises, BMI, Kidney
Disease.

# Future Improvement:

• We can make this cloud-based system.

• We can use real time sensors.

• We can use spark for model building as well as for analysis, which will increase the efficiency of our system.

• We can make the system in mobile units.

• More detailed feature engineering and feature selection will be done.

• More data can be used for better prediction.
